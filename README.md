Build a dropdown menu
You can allow the menu to show up either on click or on hover.
You should hard-code the menu items into your HTML but hide/reveal them using JavaScript. You can do this either by adding a class (visible or something) or by manually setting the style in JS.
Make sure the JavaScript code is reusable! You should be able to create multiple drop-downs on a page using HTML and reuse the JavaScript logic to hide/reveal them.
If you bundle your code into a module you can publish your package to npm, and then install and use it anytime you like! Nothing like publishing your own modules to make you feel like a pro ðŸ˜Ž.
